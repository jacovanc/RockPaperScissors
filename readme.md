Basic rock paper scissors game web app.

Allows the user to play against the 'computer' and submit the users details in a form upon winning - written to file. Uses server side code to determine outcome of the game, and validate the users form submission with Regex.
Very basic frontend with minimal javascript to simulate the game.

Created with MVC web architecture, with implemented unit tests to test the game logic and validation functions.

Made with .NET Framework 4.6.1 ASP.NET MVC 5.
